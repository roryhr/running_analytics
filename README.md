# Running Analytics

All you get right now is a pair of plots but I have plans to expand this into a cool useful dashboard.
The two plots, for now, are of pace over time and a histogram of pace. 
I'll add more as I learn more.
The app is [live](https://boiling-fjord-48225.herokuapp.com/activities/1385640587)!

## What do we have here?
Glad you asked!

1. A Flask app deployed on Heroku
2. Data from the Strava API
3. Calculations and plots from Pandas and matplotlib

That's about it for now!
